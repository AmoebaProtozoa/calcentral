module Financials
  # This model class caches a JSON translation of CFV data fetched by Financials::Proxy.
  # Including FeedExceptionsHandled makes it use a shorter-lived cache to deal with temporary CFV server problems.
  # Including JsonifiedFeed indicates that it should only cache a JSON-ified version of the feed, since calling to_json
  # on a large finances history can take a surprisingly long time and caching a raw version of the data structure
  # is unnecessary.
