          By agreeing to this authorization, I understand that the University will apply my Title IV awards to pay all outstanding charges on my UCB student account beyond registration fees, housing and phone bills. These charges may include late fees, University Health Services charges, library fines, etc. If I choose not to authorize the use of my Title IV aid to pay all outstanding charges, I assume responsibility to pay for all non-registration, housing and phone bill charges on my UCB student account by their due date. I understand that payments made after the due date may result in late fees and registration holds.
